1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp?
Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
neighter of the two experiment worked when I moved all the templated funtions to
Data.cpp or to data.h. however if only we move those templated function that are
invoked in data.cpp from data.h like min, max, sum and average and place them before
sict namespace in data.cpp they will work.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now?
Do you need to define the template function above main(),
before it is used, or can you define it below main()?

we can move any templated function to w9_lab.cpp file before main()
as long as the templated function is invoked in this module. for example
if we move readrow() and display() before main() the program still works
beacuse these functions are invoked in main(). It is as we declare and define
a function before main.


3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading
your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments?
What is the advantage of using templates?

Yes, this lab could be done without using templates just by overloading
funtion in data.h but by using the template we can reuse the code and aviod
code repeatition which results in reducing the size of the program which it
results in program proformance

4.      Are the following equivalent?
template<class T>
template<typename T>

Yes, They're equivalent and interchangeable for most of the times.
both indicate that the name following represents a parameterized type placeholder
that will be replaced by a c/c++ predefined or user defined type.

quiz reflection:
I have not recieved my quiz papar for week 10 yet. I will answer the quiz in next
assignment sumbimssion if I had any mistake.
