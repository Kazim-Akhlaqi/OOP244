1) How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why? 
There are 41 element in total. 40 for the maximum number of charecters stored in array and 1 for the newline charecter.

2) Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error.  Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
The function overloading feature allow declaration of two member functions with the same name as long as they have different parameters and types.
