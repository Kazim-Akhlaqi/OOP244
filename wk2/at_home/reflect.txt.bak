1) Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
Since the first array is constant, we cant increase its size, so We need to allocate new dynamic memory to save temporarily the data stored in the first array, and then deallocate the space occupied by first array and then copy the new array data to the first array which will increase its size.
2) The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array of char-acters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name. Why don’t we need to use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain.



3) There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function? 

The compiler distinguishes the difference bettween two fuctions by the difference in the functions's parameters.

4) Explain what have you have learned in this workshop.
