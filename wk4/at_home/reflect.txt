-------------------

1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe emp-ty state?
   Safe empty state is the act of Initializing an object's instance variables in a constructor to ensuree
   that the object has a well-defined state. This way objects do not break and behave as expected from 
   the time of their creation and another way is to initialize the variable at the time of declaration.

2) Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
   we can minimize code duplication by using function pointers or pointers to member functions.

3) Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.
   Since the C++ compilers apply privacy at the class level and the member function can access any private member of its class,
   including any data member of any instance of its class, therefore the canTravelWith Member function can access the private
   member of it's calss.

4) What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) func-tion executes correctly?
   char * strncpy ( char * destination, const char * source, size_t num );
   First we need to provide the desitnation parameter which is a pointer to the destination array 
   where the content is to be copied, Sencond the source parameter which is a C string to be copied
   to destination parameter and third the size parameter which is an unsigned integer type that holds
   the maximum number of charecter copied from source to desitnation parameter.

5) Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
   I have learnt how to define a constructor that initializes an object’s data at creation time
   and also how to sets an object to a safe empty state by defining a default constructor as well as
   accessing the private data members of a class.

Quiz 4 Reflection:

1. What is the difference between C++ class and C++ object?
In C++ programming language a Class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created
and object is an instance of a class. 

3. Char* course;
   course = new char [7];
   delete [] course;
   course = nullptr;

Quiz 5 Reflection:

Item::increase(int qty){
      quantity += qty;
      return *this;
      }
